This repositorie contains the code for the MPC algorithm presented in the paper "Synthesis of Majority Expressions through Primitive Function Manipulation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01486).

The files 2Lvl3.txt, 2Lvl4.txt and 2Lvl5.txt contains the LUT table (M2 Table) for 3, 4 and 5 input functions, respectively.

The algorithm was encoded in C++ for Windows.
